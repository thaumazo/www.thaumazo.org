// Creator // Conceptualizer // Connector //

A University of British Columbia Cognitive Systems (Linguistics) alumnus from Toronto who wants to inspire the world through connection, creativity, community, and sparking change.

Passionate designer, facilitator, artist, photographer, videographer, writer, singer songwriter, music cognition enthusiast, and traveler who is always pursuing new skills, mediums, ideas, and opportunities to explore and play. 2024 saw the exploration of the mycelial spaces of visual art, concert photography, community building, and Thaumazo contracting (with Through Human Eyes and One Caring Human and Thaumazo development), as well as Project 52sday, a project a week for the entire year, posted on https://www.instagram.com/project52sday/, an offshoot of their brand Raeny Tuesday.

Rae shines in interdisciplinary embodied spaces, where play, curiosity, and novelty thrive. Connecting people and ideas, Rae drives ideation and action through frameworks, facilitation, and craft. They are driven by "why"s and "what if"s, generating essences and themes, emerging dreams of what could be, and executing on iterative prototypes towards those north stars. Patterns and signal recognition lie at the heart of their momentum, leading to a medium and modality agnostic workflow leading to flexible, dynamic, and inspiring outcomes.
