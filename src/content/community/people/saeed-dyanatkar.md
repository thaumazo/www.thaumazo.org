With background in systems design and digital media, I have been working in academe on using emerging technologies to enhance learning and knowledge translation.
While leading a creative team at UBC Studios, I have initiated the award-wining Emerging Media Lab at UBC as an innovation space for UBC community to explore and experiment with emerging technologies and immersive media.
