As an artist and entrepreneur, I spent 15 years leading circus training events and creating online courses. I managed brand development, social media strategies, and photo and video production.

As a lover of nature, I spent winters volunteering at a wildlife rescue centre in Costa Rica, where I had the privilege of raising baby monkeys and helping to reintroduce Scarlet Macaws to the Nicoya Peninsula, all in coloration with a team of biologists, ecologists, and environmental advocates.

During Covid I completed a degree in communication and Sustainable Development at Simon Fraser University. My studies included systems thinking, community planning, sustainable development, and societal issues related to AI. I have continued to grow my ethics and technical understanding of AI.

I am committed to exploring pathways to social-ecological transformation by serving a hands-on role, applying my skills with design, communication, prompt engineering, and systems thinking. I spent the past year reading about approaches to self-directed learning (heutagogy) and writing an extensive "be my learning-ally) prompt that allows me to practice Cognitive-Linguistic Enhancement.
