In the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Helene, Micah acted quickly to gather, organize, and verify essential resources for hard-hit communities in Western North Carolina. Micahâ€™s strategic oversight and behind-the-scenes coordination continue to be pivotal in the ongoing effort to house displaced individuals and families, as they work to link local relief initiatives and broader community networks.

Micah is a dedicated advocate for social justice and community empowerment, with expertise in conflict management, organizational structure, and facilitation. Drawing on their experience organizing regional Burning Man events, they bring invaluable crisis management skills and a unique perspective on creating temporary infrastructure in high-pressure situations.

Micah envisions a future with stronger, more connected communities that can withstand the growing challenges of climate-related disasters. In their work with Appalachia Relief, Micah is focusing on long-term solutions that drive healing and create lasting change.
