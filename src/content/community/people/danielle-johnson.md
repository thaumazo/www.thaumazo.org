Danielle Johnson is an emergent leader and transdisciplinary thinker, whose work explores the intersection of psychological development, community building, and socio-ecological transformation. With over 15 years of experience across academia, nonprofit sectors, and community organizing, Danielle brings a unique perspective to fostering deliberately developmental spaces. She holds a deep commitment to lifelong learning, curiosity, positive psychology, and the study of flow and creativity.

Danielle's journey into the transformative ecosystem began after a shift from corporate America and academia, where she focused on a unified theory of psychology but found herself gravitating toward the nonprofit world. Despite challenges and feeling like an outsider at times, she has channeled her energy into creating spaces that nurture psychological and community growth. Her work is deeply influenced by her experiences organizing field studies, particularly the Liminal Landscape Survey, and co-founding Limoncon, an online gathering designed as a deliberately developmental space for emergent leaders.

Danielle's personal and professional experiences converge in her ability to bridge various worldsâ€”whether it's connecting her work in the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice with broader socio-ecological initiatives or linking different intellectual communities in spaces like Emerge Austin. Her approach to leadership is rooted in collaboration, fostering collective intelligence, and leaning into personal growth.

Committed to the idea of psychological and social development, Danielle has been influenced by thinkers like Carol Sanford, Robert Kegan, and Adrienne Maree Brown, integrating their ideas into her work on field building and network development. She is also known for her strong sense of community and her ability to create supportive, non-egoic environments that allow others to grow and thrive.

In her own words, Danielle believes in the power of deliberately developmental processes to transform individuals and communities alike, shaping the ecosystems needed for a regenerative future.
