Danielle Johnson is an emergent leader and transdisciplinary thinker, whose work explores the intersection of psychological development, community building, and socio-ecological transformation. With over 20 years of experience across academia, corporate, nonprofit sectors, and community organizing, Danielle brings a unique perspective to fostering deliberately developmental spaces. She holds a deep commitment to lifelong learning, curiosity, personal leadership and the study of flow and creativity.  

Danielle's journey into the meta-crisis informed ecosystem, began after a series of transcendental experiences.  These experiences served as a catalyst, emboldening her to dedicate her life to combating problematic systems in pursuit of a more regenerative planet. She has channeled her energy into creating spaces that nurture psychological maturation and community growth. 

Danielle's personal and professional experiences converge in her ability to bridge various worlds—whether it's connecting her work in the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice with broader socio-ecological initiatives, or linking different intellectual communities in spaces like Limicon, Transdisciplinary Leadership Review, Life Itself’s Second Renaissance project, Everyone Welcome, and Regenerate Midwest. Her approach to leadership is rooted in collaboration, fostering collective intelligence, and leaning into personal growth.  

Committed to the idea of psychological and social development, Danielle has been influenced by thinkers like Carol Sanford and Robert Kegan, integrating their ideas into her work on field building and network development. She is also known for her strong sense of community and her ability to create supportive, non-egoic environments that allow others to grow and thrive.  Danielle is one of the co-founders of Limicon, an online gathering designed as an emergent event to weave individuals within the meta-crisis informed ecosystem, while simultaneously acting as a deliberately developmental space for emergent leaders. 

In her own words, Danielle believes in the power of deliberately developmental processes to transform individuals and communities alike, shaping the ecosystems needed for a regenerative future.
