Melanda is an organizational development professional with several decades of experience spanning the hospitality industry in Canada, to humanitarian relief and international development in sub-Saharan Africa. She holds a Master of Arts in Human Security and Peacebuilding, and considers her greatest gifts to be nurturing connectedness and co-creating effective, relationship-based systems and culture in organizations. She is a co-founder and Director of Thaumazo, and the current Executive Director of Conservancy Hornby Island. An avid reader, practical dreamer, and friend to human and non-human kin alike, she feels deep affinity for the work of the Red Alder tree. She is grateful to the traditional stewards, since time immemorial, of the land where she lives – the K’omoks and Tla’amin First Nations.
