Brenda Keesal is a multi-modal artist, love activist and creator of transformative gatherings. Fusing her talent and vision with her love of people, her emotional-action work provokes, uplifts and inspires.

As a writer and indie filmmaker, Brenda’s award-winning films WANKER and Jack & Ella garnered cult status and played theatrically, on TV, the internet and at international festivals. Her blog Burns the Fire inspired a passionate following and won multiple WordPress awards.

In 2015, Brenda founded the original Storytime, an interactive oral storytelling lab in her neighbourhood café. She guides an incredible diversity of groups through the triumphs and heartbreaks of their lives, weaving their stories together and building bridges to each other.

Storytime is the root system of Brenda’s broader vision, The Village, an oral storytelling and media platform and global peace initiative. She lives to inspire and bring people together.
