The Community Mycelium is a combination of several elements designed to help small, emergent, and self-organizing organizations thrive:

- A data structure (currently offered as a Notion Template) designed to It helps track people, communities, projects, events, tasks as well as a range of underlying elements such as AI prompts and Microcredentials.
- An approach to meetings and facilitation designed to promote collective intelligence, decision making, and an agile approach to work.
- Automations and AI processing to facilitate operations, administration, collective intelligence, synergy finding and cross-pollination between people and organizations.

We are currently in the process of developing a fully open source implementation.
