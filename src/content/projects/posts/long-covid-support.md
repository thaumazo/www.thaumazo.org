People with Long Covid frequently find themselves in a challenging bind: they have a strong need to keep up with rapidly evolving research that impacts their lives, while also frequently suffering from brain fog, chronic fatigue, and a range of other conditions. This is compounded by a common lack of understanding around Long Covid and its related conditions.

The first phase of the Long Covid project is to provide a service allowing patients, their health practitioners, and their family and other caregivers to receive accurate summaries of the research, articles and news most relevant to them in language and format appropriate to their context.

The second phase aims to provide opportunities for those with Long Covid to gather virtually to support one another and share their struggles, insights, experiences and learning, and where participants are willing, to use Large Language Models to weave the transcripts from those sessions into collective intelligence, potential projects and action.
