AI & Us: A Human Conversation was a seven-part series of intimate, heart-centered conversations exploring the personal, societal, and philosophical implications of artificial intelligence. Each gathering brought together a diverse group of artists, technologists, educators, ethicists, futurists, and curious minds to reflect on AI not as a purely technical force, but as a mirror for human values, fears, dreams, and relationships.

Rather than focusing on hype, productivity, or profit-driven narratives, these sessions invited participants to engage from the heart—sharing their concerns, hopes, and questions about AI’s role in shaping our future. The space emphasized deep listening, relational presence, and mutual learning, drawing from traditions like the Way of Council and influenced by creative and activist perspectives.

Themes ranged from the nature of intelligence and wisdom to the risks of exponential change, the potential for AI to support human flourishing, and the importance of grounding technology in love, ethics, and ecological awareness.

Designed by Brenda Keesal and Daniel Lindenberger and facilitated by Brenda, a diverse group was brought together one each call to explore a wide range of issues.
