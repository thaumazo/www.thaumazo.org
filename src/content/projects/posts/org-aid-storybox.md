Thaumazo was pleased to provide organizational, facilitation, and ideation support for the Storybox team.

**Storybox** was an ambitious project to create a digital platform for creating, sharing, and managing stories and creative projects that centered indigenous practices around creation and rights management of story, song and story.

At its core, Storybox supports **self-sovereign storytelling**: users retain control over their creative content and data while engaging in a vibrant, collaborative ecosystem. Whether you're documenting community knowledge, producing a film, writing a paper, or launching a grassroots initiative, Storybox gives you the tools to develop your project, connect with aligned creators, and share your work in meaningful ways.

Built on principles of **mutual aid, trust, and decentralized governance**, Storybox isn't just another content platform. It’s a living network where users support each other through digital potlucks of shared tools, skills, and resources. Each project becomes a node in a broader ecosystem of practice—rich with collaboration, mentorship, and co-creation.
