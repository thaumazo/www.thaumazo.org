Aid Arena is an initiative of Conversa Corps, which brings together members from various international governmental agencies, NGOs and other groups involved in crisis response to foster more effective collaboration, approaches and infrastructure during events.

Aid Arena will be beginning to put on its own training simulation events to practice response, using established techniques their team has used or created with other organizations.

At the heart of the training are three teams:
Red Team simulates the event (wildfire, earthquake, refugee emergency)

White Team practices the response effort

Blue Team administers and evaluates the training

Thaumazo is meeting with Aid Arena to discuss the possibility of working with our AI & Us Working Group and other partners to form a Green Team, whose engagement over 3 simulations (likely a 2 - 3 year project) would involve 3 stages:

Training 1) Capture as much information about the event as possible, including all platforms used, pedagogy, communications between team members for each team, etc.

Training 2) Provide Mycelial and LLM Integrative support for each of the 3 teams in their work.

Training 3) Work with partners to develop systems for each team, which at their heart would have fine tuned LLMs / AI Agents trained up on the results of past simulations, after action reports, operations manuals, etc.

The goal would be the eventual creation of a White Team Agent capable of assisting during real world events, though this would require extensive testing.

Initial stages of this project could be done relatively easily, with further stages likely requiring significant funding, which sounds like it is probably accessible via grants.
