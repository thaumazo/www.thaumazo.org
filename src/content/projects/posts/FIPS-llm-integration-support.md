[FIPS-Africa](https://fipsafrica.org/) is a not-for-profit company based in Kenya, dedicated to enhancing food security for smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. They focus on providing farmers with advisory services and access to inputs and technologies needed to increase agricultural productivity in a sustainable manner. Their approach integrates various components, such as employing self-employed village-based advisors (VBAs) to disseminate inputs and information, to ensure comprehensive support for farmers to achieve food security.

Thaumazo is honoured to be working with FIPS-Africa to help their team transform their knowledge systems by using Large Language Models and other tools to build collective intelligence, streamline operations and administrative tasks, and support the work of their entire team.

Starting from curiosity and listening, Thaumazo is working to help map FIPS-Africa's knowledge flow, from villages to field workers to headquarters and back, and identify places where AI can help improve that flow while centering human experience, knowledge and connection at each step.

Weâ€™re excited to be exploring themes of decentralization and decolonization of knowledge systems with their team.
