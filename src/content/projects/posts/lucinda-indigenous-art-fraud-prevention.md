Thaumazo's Fraudulent Native Art Initiative is dedicated to addressing the issue of fraudulent Indigenous art while providing vital support to Indigenous artists. This multifaceted project encompasses two key phases:

Phase 1 (Complete): The successful creation of a comprehensive Notion tool greatly supported Lucinda Turner in her work. This tool streamlined her efforts and underwent multiple rounds of refinements, positively impacting the Indigenous art community.

Phase 2 (Needs Partner): Currently seeking potential partners for implementation, this phase aims to engage Indigenous student volunteers through Riipen's Level UP program. By joining forces with like-minded organizations, we aim to empower Indigenous students and enhance the project's impact.
Thaumazo is actively exploring collaborative opportunities to continue this important mission, protect the integrity of Indigenous art, and promote the work of Indigenous artists.
