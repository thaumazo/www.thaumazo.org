"Emerging Stewards" is an initiative to empower an intergenerational community of innovators dedicated to creating sustainable solutions for global challenges. By integrating the dynamism of high school students, the fresh perspectives of post-secondary students, and the seasoned insights of adults from various walks of life, the project fosters a diverse ecosystem for collaboration and innovation. Utilizing emerging technologies, an agile approach to project formation and management in an open-source spirit, "Emerging Stewards" aims to ideate, develop, document, and share real-world projects that contribute positively to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). Through a supportive online platform, participants gain access to a wealth of resources, mentorship opportunities, and a global network, enabling them to transform ambitious ideas into impactful realities.
