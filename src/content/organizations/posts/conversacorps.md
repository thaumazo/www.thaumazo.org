Conversa Corps is an organization that enhances the collaboration among individuals and teams responding to crises by offering online tools and services. These services include robust chat platforms, a community database, and support for coordinating missions during events like wildfires and other emergencies. Their approach focuses on preemptive setup for communication and collaboration to effectively manage disaster responses and improve outcomes.
