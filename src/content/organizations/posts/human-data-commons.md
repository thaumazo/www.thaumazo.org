The Human Data Commons Foundation (HDC) is a non-profit organization based in Vancouver, Canada, committed to fostering a sustainable and equitable digital future. HDC integrates technology, ethics, and consciousness to ensure mindful development and use of tech. It supports these principles through events like the annual ParTecK, open-source tech advocacy, and by offering seed grants to promote innovative projects at the intersection of technology and ethical practices.
