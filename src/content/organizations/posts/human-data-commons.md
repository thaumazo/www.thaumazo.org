The Human Data Commons Foundation (HDC) was a non-profit organization based in Vancouver, Canada, committed to fostering a sustainable and equitable digital future. HDC integrated technology, ethics, and consciousness to ensure mindful development and use of tech. It supported these principles through events like the annual ParTecK, open-source tech advocacy, and by offering seed grants to promote innovative projects at the intersection of technology and ethical practices.

Thaumazo assisted HDC in a set of "Bardo Discussions" whose end result was the decision to wind down the organization, with Thaumazo continuing to provide organizational support to the ParTecK community moving forward.
