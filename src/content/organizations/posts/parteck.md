The ParTecK initiative, organized by the Human Data Commons Foundation, is an annual gathering initiated in 2017 that brings together social innovators, tech innovators, and thought leaders. This invite-only event features diverse participants and offers thought-provoking presentations and opportunities for unique collaborations. Themes change annually, focusing on the intersection of technology with various aspects of life and society, ranging from Web3 and the "web of life" to big data, governance, and ethics.
