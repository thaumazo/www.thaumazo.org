Appalacia Relief is committed to supporting Southern Appalachia by providing real-time, reliable recovery information to those impacted by Hurricane Helene. Our mission is simple: empower residents with crowdsourced, vetted, secure resources they can trust to rebuild their lives. We focus on keeping information up-to-date and easily accessible, ensuring that everyone has what they need to recover and thrive.

We believe in the strength of community and the power of collaboration. Our approach is flexible and volunteer-driven, allowing anyone to contribute based on their skills and resources. With a decentralized structure, every volunteer plays an essential role, fostering a shared sense of responsibility and respect. In the first six weeks, our efforts helped over 100,000 people access the critical resources they needed. This is proof of what can be achieved when we come together as a community.

Our commitment to recovery is grounded in humility and empathy. As needs evolve, so will our efforts. We remain dedicated to ensuring that the region’s recovery is sustainable and that all individuals can reach self-sufficiency and long-term resilience.
