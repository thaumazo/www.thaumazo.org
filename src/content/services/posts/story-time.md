### Healing through shared stories

Storytime is a transformative storytelling experience that reconnects people through the simple power of listening and being heard. In an age of disconnection, stress, and division, Storytime brings communities, teams, and individuals together to share their lived experiences — fostering empathy, joy, and belonging.

Each gathering is uniquely designed for your group — from corporate teams to nonprofits, students, seniors, and community initiatives. Participants co-create an atmosphere of warmth and openness, discovering that when one person opens their heart, others are inspired to do the same.

Both online and in-person, Storytime blends artistry, facilitation, and emotional intelligence to spark laughter, insight, and healing. It builds confidence, strengthens relationships, and reminds us of our shared humanity — one story at a time.
