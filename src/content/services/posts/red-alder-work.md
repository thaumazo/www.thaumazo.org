### Healing the Human Ecosystem of Your Organization

Red Alder Work supports organizations, communities, and teams to heal the fractures that arise from disconnection, burnout, or broken trust.

Inspired by the red alder tree—nature’s great restorer that renews soil after fire—we help human ecosystems regenerate after disruption. Through careful listening, truth-telling, and relational repair, we create the conditions for genuine trust, clarity, and collaboration to take root.

Our work nurtures leaders to become stewards of culture rather than controllers of outcomes. We help organizations embody the same integrity and wholeness internally that they aspire to manifest in the world.

Each engagement unfolds organically: mapping the ecosystem, tending relationships, cycling nutrients of wisdom across teams, and supporting new growth.

And like the red alder itself, we step aside once the system is thriving on its own—leaving behind a healthier, more connected, and more resilient community of work.
